# trie-interview-question

I was asked a question about "Trie". As the interviewer was explaining the question on the whiteboard, I recognized the algorithm which could be used is a "Trie". While I struggled with the answer during the interview, I knew I needed to attempt and complete the problem on my own. It's not complete at the moment, but it will be a work in progress, while I continue to study, code, and practice.

Here's the question: you're given a list of phrases

list_of_phrases = [ "this is a description", this is why we speak", "some sort of phrase", "that is what I said", "those are my pictures" ]
